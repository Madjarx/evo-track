# bluenet

 * The purpose of this feature is to connect to an Adam CPW Scale via Bluetooth.
 * At time of writing, we don't have decisions around "will we have another Pi on the scale?" and "should we just use a long cable?"
 * The reimplemented scale code is located in EvoEco_AWD_GUI/scales and can be ported to BLE.
  - the BLE working proof of concept code is inside evo-eve repo / android.
